## About the Architecture
![Architecture diagram](architecture_diagram.png)

- The project leverages a lot of AWS tools such as Elastic beanstalk for dynamic instancing of the backend and a load balancer for better performance.
- Traffic is encrypted from the outside world to the load balancer and from there it is assumed to be secure within Amazon's internal network.
- AWS Relation Database Service was also used to setup the MySQL database which stores the user data.
- Passwords are hashed with [Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) with a 32 byte digest.
- The data users send to their devices is never stored or logged in any fashion.
- Clientside and server side validation of phone numbers to prevent errors. All responses give an accurate status code.
- Responsive landing page built with [React](https://www.reactjs.org) and [ChakraUI](https://www.chakra-ui.com).
- Twilio provisioned phone number and SMS service
